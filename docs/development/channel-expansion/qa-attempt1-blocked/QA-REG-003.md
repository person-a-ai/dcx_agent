# QA-REG-003 — BLOCKED

Recorded: 2026-10-20T06:29:08.569101+00:00
Shared preflight interval: 2026-10-20T06:26:59.366893+00:00 – 2026-10-20T06:27:05.061306+00:00.
Intended URL: http://localhost:3000/pipeline/start
Session: unavailable (seed failed); no scenario actions were performed.

## Approved scenario (unmodified)

Priority: P1
Type: Regression
Given: 새 프로젝트를 0단계(입력)에서 만든다
When: 수집 채널 선택 칸을 연다
Then:
  - 기존 채널 선택지가 그대로 있다
  - 새 채널 4개가 선택지에 보이고, 하나를 골라 저장하면 GET /session/{sid}의 `projectContext.channels`에 그 값이 들어간다

## Attempted steps and actual result

1. Confirmed immutable HEAD and source fingerprint; read the full approved plan.
2. Started mandatory backend using QA adapter/fake embedding environment.
3. Observed startup followed by EPERM on localhost:8000 and process shutdown.
4. Opened the crawling URL in the actual isolated Chrome browser; observed connection refused.
5. Executed seed.py against the real POST /context endpoint; connection was denied.
6. Stopped at the unmet Given preconditions. No Then assertion is marked passed.

BLOCKED by environment before scenario execution. Uvicorn initialized but exited with code 3: [Errno 1] binding 127.0.0.1:8000: operation not permitted. A second captured attempt with fresh LOCAL_DATA_DIR reproduced the error. Playwright navigation to http://localhost:3000/pipeline/crawling returned net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED. Seed POST /context failed with PermissionError (operation not permitted). No session ID or application DOM was available. Final HEAD also changed externally from f22e495fa7946d5d5d18b6283049b62de95bf71a to 4e29b449cb00ff6f942b84efedf52154762a040a; source fingerprint is unchanged.
